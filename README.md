gedit
=========


Tiny line-oriented editor for the console

Inspired by the SPF editor for the IBM MVT TSO 3270 form terminals

There is a command column at the left hand side.

Can be used with only one function key, e.g ESC
 
Does not yet support typing non-ASCII-characters, 
but displays Unicode correctly, yet uneditable.
