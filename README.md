gedit
=========


Tiny line-oriented editor for the console

Inspired by the SPF editor for the IBM MVT TSO 3270 form terminals

There is a command column at the left hand side.

Can be used with only one function key, e.g ESC
 
Cannot enter or edit non-ASCII 7-bit characters,
but displays UNICODE properly, yet not editable.
